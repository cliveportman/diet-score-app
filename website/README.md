This is a React/Next.JS project hosted on Vercel: [wayofthegoat.theportman.co](https://wayofthegoat.theportman.co)

Use `yarn` for handling dependencies and scripts.

To work locally, download the latest development build from Expo, then

```
yarn install
yarn dev
```

When you're ready to deploy, just commit to *main*, preferably via a PR. Vercel will take care of the rest.
